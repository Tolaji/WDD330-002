Pull Request (PR) Notice:
Whenever we sit to work on this project, before we proceed we should always
ensure or local branch is up-to-date with the remote 'main' branch by performing a 'git pull' or 'git fetch origin
 & git reset --hard origin/main' to make local branch identical to the remote 'main' branch before we do 
 anything else so as to make sure we get changes any of us teammates have made recently. Also
lets ensure PR are reviewed always.
